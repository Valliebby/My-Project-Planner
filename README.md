# My-Project-Planner
A Project Planner App 

* As a developer with a busy schedule I wanted to create a platform wear one could add important events to a daily planner to be more time efficient and beneficial to the user. I was able to accomplished this by doing the following:

* Giving a starter code I displayed the date and time in the header with Day.js and centered the display in css.
* I presented the time blocks by each hour of the day in script.js by adding if statements to apply the past, present, or future class to each hour.
* Then I added an event listener to the save button.
* Last added save content text to local storage to the time blocks save button in script.js. 
* Thank you and hope you enjoy!
